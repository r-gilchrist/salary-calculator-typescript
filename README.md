I have loads of ideas on what I'd like to add to this, so stay tuned for added functionality/support!

## Features

- Adjustable gross salary and pension percentage inputs
- Real-time calculation updates as you type

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root directory
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. Navigate to `localhost:5500/index.html`

## Current Limitations

- Not accurate for anything over £50,0000 (apologies to all devs)
- Assumes you hold a plan 1 student loan
- Assumes you have a regular tax code (1257L)
